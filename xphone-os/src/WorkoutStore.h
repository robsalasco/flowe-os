// xphone-os Workout — dedicated workout store (PrioritiesStore's mold).
//
// Holds today's workout: up to 8 exercises, each "N sets of <free text>"
// with a completed-set count. The companion service copies every
// workout.snapshot card into this store at the parse point
// (CompanionBleService.cpp applyCardPayload), so the snapshot is captured
// even if the Workout scene was never opened — the dormant sleep frame reads
// the store directly when the device sleeps from the Workout scene.
//
// The device is increment-only: +/- adjust `done` locally (bumpDone) for an
// instant optimistic repaint, and the absolute new count is sent to the
// phone as a workout.set action (idempotent — a retried packet can't
// double-count). The phone remains the source of truth for structure; a
// fresh card replaces everything here.
//
// Main-loop-only by construction (same reasoning as PrioritiesStore): no
// mutex needed.
