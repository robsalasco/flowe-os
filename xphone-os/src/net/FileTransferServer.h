// xphone-os R2 — File Transfer HTTP server (trimmed port of CrossPoint's
// CrossPointWebServer, x4-os src/network/CrossPointWebServer.cpp).
//
// Serves the same JSON API the Flowe iOS app already speaks:
//   GET  /             tiny plain-text status (sanity check from a browser)
//   GET  /api/status   {"device","version","ip","mode","freeHeap"}
//   GET  /api/files    ?path=/books -> [{"name","size","isDirectory","isEpub"}]
//   GET  /download     ?path=/books/x.epub -> streamed file (4 KB chunks)
//   POST /upload       ?path=/books, multipart field "file" -> SD write
//   POST /delete       ?path=/books/x.epub -> remove file
//
// Deliberately dropped from CrossPoint: HTML pages, WebSockets, WebDAV,
// captive-portal DNS, fonts/settings/OPDS handlers. The only client is the
// phone app, which needs raw JSON + bytes.
//
// Threading: everything runs on the main loop via handleClient() polling
// (FileTransferScene pumps it), so SdFat access stays main-loop-only —
// the same single-task rule as the rest of xphone-os. CrossPoint needed a
// storage mutex only because other FreeRTOS tasks share its SD card.
