// xphone-os M3 — Priorities: the day's to-do list, synced from the iPhone as
// a companion BLE card and mirrored back item-by-item.
//
// Faithful port of CrossPoint's PrioritiesActivity (x4-os
// src/activities/companion/PrioritiesActivity.{h,cpp}) onto the xphone scene
// framework, with the wire protocol kept byte-identical: the iOS app pushes a
// "priorities.snapshot" card whose priorityItems are 4-element arrays
// [id, title, note, done] (PrioritiesManager.swift:124-146, up to 10 items),
// and the device answers with "priorities.sync.request" /
// "priority.toggle" commands — iOS acks a toggle by re-sending a fresh
// snapshot card, so there is no separate ack message.
//
// Controls redesigned for the X3's physical layout, exactly the
// NotificationsScene mapping: front Left/Right (and the top-edge Up/Down
// pair) move the selection UP/DOWN, CONFIRM toggles the selected priority
// done/undone (soft key DONE; SYNC re-requests the snapshot while the list is
// empty), BACK returns to the launcher. Renders only when dirty; main.cpp
// marks the scene dirty on PRIORITIES_STORE revision changes (fresh
// snapshots) and companion card/status revision changes (the header's status
// line) while this scene is on glass.
//
// All list state lives in PRIORITIES_STORE (fixed buffers, filled by the
// companion service for every snapshot — even ones that arrive while another
// scene is on glass), so handleInput()/softKeys() read it directly on the
// 10 ms input tick with zero heap copies; no per-scene caches remain.
//
// renderDormant() is the M4 sleep-frame face: Sleep.cpp draws the same
// priorities list (via the shared row renderer) instead of the wordmark when
// the store holds a snapshot.
